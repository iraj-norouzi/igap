This seemed to have solved the problem

I do not run the OS in a VM, however, the default setting was to offload checksum calculations

Before
Quote:
# ethtool -k eth0 | grep on
rx-checksumming: on
tx-checksumming: on
scatter-gather: on
tcp segmentation offload: on
udp fragmentation offload: off
generic segmentation offload: on
Disable offloading
Quote:
# ethtool -K eth0 tx off rx off
# /etc/init.d/network restart
After
Quote:
# ethtool -k eth0 | grep on
scatter-gather: on
tcp segmentation offload: off
udp fragmentation offload: off
generic segmentation offload: on
